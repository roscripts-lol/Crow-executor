# Crow-executor
This ui was made by roscripts and will not be updated daily.
It is not perfect and I did not try on it but you may be able to use it as a base for a executor you can improve
The sln is probably not going to be added until tomorrow because I dont even have windows installed on my hdd yet xD
if you want to give suggestions join my discord! Please be patient with me as I am not in a good situtation for tech related things right now,
my laptop screen doesnt work but I did find a external monitor but I lack motivation.

So what do you choose? patience, or pressure.
